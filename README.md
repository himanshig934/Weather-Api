# Weather-Api

This is a Weather App created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to search for any city and get real-time weather information using a public Weather API. It displays temperature, Location conditions, and Current Date. This project helped me understand API integration, JSON handling, and DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript.
